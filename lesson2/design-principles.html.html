            <p>
              Nexflix is a good example of Hick’s Law. Nexflix has a huge
              database of movies and TV Shows. The user can spend a very long
              time searching just to find something to watch. Netfilx has
              designed its site to help the user out by doing a few things.
              First there is suggested videos. Then there are several tiers of
              categories to help narrow the options to a more manageable
              selection.

          <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
          <div class="principle-body">
            <h4>Google</h4>
            <p><a class="link" href="https://www.google.com">google.com</a></p>

            />
            <p>
              Google has a very clean design and uses plenty of whitespace. Even
              though it is a powerful tool that can access every corner of the
              internet it manages to keep a clean and user-friendly design. The
              user is drawn right to the search field and does not have many
              other options to distract from the main purpose of the site.

            <p>
              Amazon applies Fitts Law throughout its website. First if you have
              not signed in yet the users focus goes right to a large bright
              yellow, easy to press button to sign in. Then the search bar and
              button are large and right on the top of the screen. Once the user
              finds and item, they want the pattern is repeated to get the user
              to easily purchase the item
